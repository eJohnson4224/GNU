# TODOS:

## get_next_line_bonus

- [x] Get the code working (duh)
- [x] You were saying `get_next_line_utils.h` / `bonus` should be `get_next_line.h` / `bonus`?
- [x] norminette `TOO_MANY_FUNCS` in utils ðŸ¤¤. Split memory functions into another library?

## get_next_line

- [x] Let it live completely in its own directory as we do with bonus for now. Or do you need to submit them together?
- [ ] In VS Code install "Recommended Extensions" (if you don't already have these) and proceed norminette'ing (https://github.com/42School/norminette)

# Misc
- [ ] Merge my PR to main to be tidy, tag the now running old code at its current HEAD
- [ ] Optional: Install Gitlens and OrbStack (so you can easily spin-up Linux machines for testing)
